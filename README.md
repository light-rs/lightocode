**Exocortex principes v.1**

1. No fixed sizes, colors, fonts. pages of text. Total scalability and adaptability
2. Multimodal* revisions history // we have one super-file which includes all pdf, photos, videos, code. applications in this system (*at least 4: general, technical, by section/document, by user, and combinations of them) 
3. Super high data security: 
a) no file or draft can be deleted accidentally except by damaging
HDD
b) everything is encrypted on sub-military (sounds cool) level at once. after a quick-key combination (like word ecarlate 321) you need to enter a password
c) all data stored only in computer hard drives, no Ourel-style corporations
4. Multimodal* flexible** hierarchy. 
*Example of hierarсhy: time, logical (wheel — part of car), etc. It means that files should be sorted (in folders or objects on scheme) like: 2020y contains [jan] [fev] which contains [1 week] [2 week], 
** Flexibility means:
a) easy sorting or accommodation in folders by tags
b) auto-add tags like: add tag "irrelevant" to all files created before 2012 or contain word "management". it should also be easy to integrate ai to do this
5. Some notes contains rigid grammar texts, examp health: once [date, time] how much is needed [part of body] [sensation] [accommodation], which can automatically redacted (prh4 item b)
6. All paragraphs/sentences have numbers and internal links
7. it should have a simple super high-level programming language, not much simpler than python, but a friendlier module library. so that you can easily use habitual links and parametrs, like dispersion of degrese and humidity on week on yandex.com/weather/. He needs to create own clone from very weak ai which will take over most of the management of notes, to-do list and computer
8. System of permanent learning of his functions. Like notifications with tips sometimes or constant elements (which disappear in anki style when you use tips) On photo examples
9. System monitoring condition of user: typing speed, time to correspondence of actions to biorhythm: if I work while I should eat, or work more than N minutes without break for eyes and body exercises eth (remember that everything is integrated with todo, medical recomendations etc)


**Stakeholders that can pay for part of functions if they are designed enough for professional use/integrated with his apps or systems**

— needing reliable storage of information: journalists, small scale politicians, writers, NDA signers

— large collectives, especially those which work on complex systems

— automatization fans (nerds)

— doctors, fitness trainers and coaches to monitor clients using a smart algorithm/members of the movement quantified self 

— any company that needs to improve productivity or keep workers healthy for pc

But my strategy just jet money  to develop a conceived tool for enhancing thinking in general.  Therefore, the solutions chosen for sale should, ideally, allow you to effectively add other functions
